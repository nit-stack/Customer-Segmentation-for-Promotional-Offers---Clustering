1.1 Data Description

Rows: 210
Columns: 7
Data Types: All values are of type float64.
Null Values: None
Duplicate Rows: None
Outliers: Outliers were detected in the columns probability_of_full_payment and min_payment_amount. However, the number of outliers is very low and not significant.

1.2 Univariate Analysis
Frequency Polygon and Histogram: Used to understand the shape of the distribution.
Violin Plot: Visualized data to understand distribution.
Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF): Plotted to show the distribution of data points.
